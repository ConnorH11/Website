    <h2>
        <u>What is a VPN?</u>
    </h2>
    <p>
        A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is exactly what it sounds like. It is a virtual private network. 
The VPN connects an end users' device (PC, laptop, phone, etc.) to another computer on a 
different network in another area around the world. For example, if you connect to a VPN in 
Canada when you live in the United States, it makes it seem like you are accessing a resource 
from that website. Doing this could allow the user to access resources that the user would not
have been able to from the United States. A common example of this happening is Netflix. 
Certain countries have certain streaming libraries available so if you wanted to watch a movie 
only available in the UK, you can VPN into the UK and be able to watch it while being in the 
United States.
    </p> <br>
    <p>
        A VPN encrypts the end-user's traffic all the way until it makes it to the VPN server. This 
encryption does a few things. It changes your IP address to the IP address of the VPN server you 
are connected to. This encryption also prevents your ISP from seeing the websites you visit while 
connected to the VPN. 
    </p> <br>
    <p>
    Below is a picture of what it looks like when an end user connects to a VPN and how it makes its 
way out to the internet.

    <p>
        In this picture made by Joe Robinson, it shows how an end user’s device (the laptop) connects to 
the internet through a VPN. The first step is to install a VPN client app on your device and 
connect to it. When you connect to the VPN, it encrypts your traffic and takes you to your router. 
Your router sends your still encrypted data to the ISP. Your ISP sends the encrypted data to the 
VPN server you are connecting to which then allows you to access the internet. 
    </p><br>

    <!--What are the different uses of VPNs-->
<h2><u>What are the different uses of a VPN?</u></h2>
<p>There are many other uses of VPNs besides getting access to content not available in your 
    country. A VPN allows the user to browse the internet privately by encrypting the users traffic 
    and masking your IP address. You can make public Wi-Fi more secure for yourself and your 
    devices by preventing hackers from intercepting your traffic. You can set up a VPN tunnel from 
    a portable device to a device not as portable such as a desktop. This allows you to access that 
    desktop remotely and manage and access files on it.
    </p><br>
    <!--What are the downsides of using a VPN-->
<h2><u>What are the downsides to using a VPN?</u></h2>
<p>
    Even though VPNs are effective at encrypting your traffic, there are some things that VPNs are 
not as good at. For example, some VPNs can decrease your internet speed. VPNs encrypt your 
traffic up until you reach the internet. This means that the user does not have any more security 
once you reach the internet. Free and cheap VPNs could also collect your data while you are 
connected to it. One of the main downsides of VPNs is that the good ones cost a lot of money. 
What you pay is what you get. You could pay for a popular and good VPN provider such as 
NordVPN for $16 a month, you could go for a cheaper option, or go for a free option. Free VPNs 
you should use at your own risk as some have been found to keep logs and sell user data to third 
party companies.

<!--What are the different types of VPNs?-->
<h2><u>What are the different types of VPNs?</u></h2>
<p>There are many types of VPNs. The main ones are site-to-site VPNs, Remote access VPNs, 
    Cloud VPN, and SSL VPN.</p><br>
    <p>Site-to-Site VPNs connect multiple networks in different areas across the internet. Site-to-Site 
        VPNs are common in businesses with multiple branches. These businesses connect the networks 
        from each branch to create secure pathways to send and receive data between the LANs. This 
        allows the main branches to be able to connect with other branches of the company to 
        communicate with each other and vice versa.</p><br>
        <p>
            Remote access VPNs allow users to make a remote connection with their office computer to 
access company resources and applications while away from the office. It encrypts all the data 
transferred and sent from the user to the company computer to make a secure connection.
        </p><br>
        <p>Cloud VPN, hosted VPN, or VPN as a service is like remote access VPNs. Instead of making a 
            VPN connection to an office computer, you are making a connection to the business's cloud 
            environment to access business applications and files.</p><br>
        <p>
            SSL VPN (Secure Sockets Layer VPN) uses the SSL protocol or TLS protocol to encrypt the 
            user's data while using a VPN. The main difference between an SSL VPN and another VPN is 
            there is no need for client software when using an SSL VPN. Rather it uses a normal web 
            browser to make a connection. The two types of SSL VPNs include SSL Portal and SSL Tunnel. 
            An SSL Portal brings the user to a single webpage called a portal that has links to private 
            resources that the user can access. To access this page, you will need to put in some sort of 
            credentials to verify that you have authorization to access said resources. An SSL Tunnel VPN 
            allows the users to access private resources like the portal VPN. The main difference is that it 
            allows access to web applications as well, not just web-based apps. 
        </p><br>
        <!--Free or paid VPNs-->
        <h2><u>Free or Paid VPNs?</u></h2>
        <p>As I have stated earlier, what you pay is what you get. The more expensive a VPN service is, the 
            better it will be. The cheaper it is the less secure and reliable it could be. The average paid VPN 
            has 256-bit encryption while the average free VPN has 128-bit encryption. One thing to look out 
            for when looking for a VPN is what protocols they use. One protocol you should look for is 
            OpenVPN. Free services more than likely sell your data to third party apps to make revenue as 
            they are not making it from their free VPN. Free VPNs might have ads and data limits unless you 
            buy a subscription that removes these restrictions. Paid VPNs also are less likely to go down and 
            most of them offer a 24/7 support chat if you run into any issues.</p><br>
        <p>So, should you invest in free or paid VPN services? As in most cases, paid services are usually 
            better and offer more than free services. The main concern is how you will be using these 
            services and what features do you need. If you are connecting to a public network occasionally 
            and want to make sure your data is safe, then a free VPN would work perfect for that. If you 
            want more features included and a better performance overall, then a paid VPN would suit you 
            more.</p>
